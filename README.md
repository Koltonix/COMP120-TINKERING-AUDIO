## Contract Information
- Unity 2018.4.2f1

### Contract #1 - Sound Effect Generation (Diegetic Audio)
*You are currently been tasked with creating a tool which will generate sound
effects, these should consist of sequences of tone as well as sample manipulations.
The sound effect should be clearly tied to an action the player makes in
the game (e.g., picking up an item, attacking, walking over a trap, or so on).
An element of procedurality is expected to vary the tones*

### Contract #4 - User Interface Audio (Non-Diegetic Audio)
*You need to develop a tool to generate audio for the user interface. These
should be short tones to feed back to the player that they are successfully
navigating the user interface and configuring the gameâ€™s settings. This should
be somewhat consistent across the interface, but the tones and samples
should be modified in a systematic way to indicate success or failure. A variety
of settings should be made available and configurable by a designer*

#### Requirements
